# Stay Focused!
Program that keeps selected Windows window focused.

This program lists all processes in Windows in a combo box.  When one
of the processes is selected, all windows of that program are listed
and inserted into another combo box. When a window is selected and big
"Stay Focused!" button is pushed, the program will run infinite loop
in a timer forcing the selected window to remain the active window.

Please note that program sleeps when its own window is selected. To
start focusing, you need to activate a window of a different program.

Stay Focused! also allows to manipulate style flags of windows.
